# Privacy Policy

**Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

This Chrome extension (the “Extension”) is designed to enhance the Roblox website experience by restoring or displaying certain publicly available profile features, such as visit counts and group rank information, that were previously available on Roblox.

Your privacy is important. This policy explains what data the Extension may access, how it is used, and how it is protected.

## Data Collection and Use

### Data the Extension May Access

The Extension may access the following categories of data **only while you are actively using the Roblox website**:

* **Website content**
  This includes publicly available information displayed on Roblox web pages, such as text, images, links, and metadata necessary to display restored profile features.

* **User activity (limited scope)**
  The Extension may detect basic interactions with the Roblox website (such as page navigation or clicks) strictly as required to determine when and where to display extension features.

### How Data Is Used

Any accessed data is used **solely** to:

* Display restored or enhanced Roblox profile features
* Improve functionality and reliability of the Extension
* Ensure compatibility with Roblox website updates

All data processing occurs locally in your browser unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Data Storage

* The Extension does **not** store personal data on external servers.
* Any locally stored data (such as user preferences or cached values) remains on your device and can be removed at any time by uninstalling the Extension.

---

## Data Sharing

The developer certifies that:

* User data is **not sold, transferred, or shared** with third parties.
* User data is **not used or transferred** for purposes unrelated to the Extension’s single purpose.
* User data is **not used or transferred** to determine creditworthiness, lending eligibility, or financial profiling.

## Third-Party Services

Roblox is a third-party website governed by its own privacy policy. This Extension operates independently and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Roblox.
